<h2>About Pinging</h2>
<p>
  An unreliable internet connection...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is so...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frustrating!<br />
</p>
<p>
  Pinging.net quickly determines if you are online by running multiple tests. It then continues to
  monitor your connection via repeated tests including a "web ping" every second to help identify
  intermittent network issues.
</p>

<h2 id="webping">Web Ping</h2>
<p>
  Every second a WebRTC message is sent and returned by the server.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a> is used for the underlying
  transport mechanism so dropped messages are not retried which is desired in order to determine
  packet loss. Dropped packets will show up as red squares. The round trip time of each ping is
  graphed and can be viewed in the log or by hovering over the graph.
</p>

<h2 id="http">HTTP Test</h2>
<p>
  Makes a HTTP POST request with a random string body and verifies it is returned properly. Caching
  of the request is also explicitly disabled.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> is the foundational
  transportation technology used on the web.
</p>

<h2 id="dns">DNS Test</h2>
<p>
  A HTTP GET request to a [random-number]dns-check.pinging.net. Caching is explicitly disabled and
  the random number part of the subdomain prevents common caching of the DNS lookup.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> is the system that converts
  domain names (e.g. pinging.net) to an address that a computer understands (e.g. 192.168.100.100).
</p>

<h2 id="browser">Browser Check</h2>
<p>
  Web browsers report if they believe you are offline. If this check is failing it means you are
  likely not connected to your WiFi, cellular connection or ethernet cord. This is a basic check and
  it will often pass even if you are not connected. This check is continuously monitored by your
  browser.
</p>

<h2 id="initial">Initial Load Check</h2>
<p>
  Caching is disabled for this site so if this site loads it is a strong indication your internet is
  working at the time of loading the site.
</p>
