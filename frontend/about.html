<h1>About Pinging.net</h1>
<p>
  An unreliable internet connection...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is so...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frustrating!<br />
</p>
<p>
  Pinging.net quickly determines if you are online by running multiple tests. It then continues to
  monitor your connection via repeated tests including a "web ping" every second to help identify
  intermittent network issues.
</p>

<h2 id="webping">Web Ping</h2>
<p>
  A Web Ping is sent every second.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)">Ping</a> is a common network
  testing utility. A packet is sent to a computer over the network which replies with a response
  packet. If and how fast a response is received help determine network connection quality. Normally
  ping packets are sent using the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">ICMP</a> protocol but
  that is not possible from a web page. Instead a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> data channel message is sent to and
  returned from the server.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a> is used for the underlying
  transport mechanism so dropped messages are not retried which is desired in order to determine
  packet loss.
</p>
<h2 id="rtt">Round Trip Time</h2>
<p>
  The round trip time of each ping is graphed as a dark green horizontal line for each second. It is
  also displayed in milliseconds for the last received ping and the average for all successful
  pings.
</p>
<h2 id="packetloss">Packet Loss</h2>
<p>
  Packet loss is when a ping response is not received. It is graphed as a red square. The percent of
  all pings that were lost is also displayed. Packet loss is caused by many different factors and
  potentially indicates issues with your internet connection.
</p>

<h2 id="http">HTTP Test</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> is the foundational
  transportation technology used on the web.
</p>
<p>
  Makes a HTTP POST request with a random string body and verifies it is returned properly. Caching
  of the request is also explicitly disabled.
</p>

<h2 id="dns">DNS Test</h2>
<p>
  The Domain Name System (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>) is the
  system that converts domain names (e.g. pinging.net) to an address that a computer understands
  (e.g. 192.168.100.100).
</p>
<p>
  Test that DNS is working by making a HTTP GET request to a [random-number]dns-check.pinging.net.
  Caching is explicitly disabled and the random number part of the subdomain prevents common caching
  of the DNS lookup.
</p>

<h2 id="browser">Browser Check</h2>
<p>
  Web browsers report if they believe you are offline. If this check is failing it means you are
  likely not connected to your WiFi, cellular connection or ethernet cord. This is a basic check and
  it will often pass even if you are not connected. This check is continuously monitored by your
  browser.
</p>

<h2 id="initial">Initial Load Check</h2>
<p>
  Unlike most internet sites, caching is not allowed for this site. If this site loads, it is a
  strong indication your internet was working at the time it was loaded.
