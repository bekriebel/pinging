  <h1>About Pinging.net</h1>
  <p>
    An unreliable internet connection...<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is so...<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frustrating!<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Pinging.net quickly determines if you are online by running multiple tests. It then continues to
    monitor your connection via repeated tests including a "web ping" every second to help identify
    intermittent network issues.
  </p>

  <h2 id="webping">Web Ping</h2>
  <p>
    A Web Ping is sent every second.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)">Ping</a> is a common network
    testing utility. A packet is sent to a computer over the network which replies with a response
    packet. If and how fast a response is received help determine network connection quality.
    Normally ping packets are sent using the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">ICMP</a> protocol but
    that is not possible from a web page. Instead a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> data channel message is sent to and
    returned from the server.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a> is used for the
    underlying transport mechanism so dropped messages are not retried which is desired in order to
    determine packet loss.
  </p>
  <h2 id="rtt">Round Trip Time</h2>
  <p>
    The round trip time of each ping is graphed as a dark green horizontal line for each second. It
    is also displayed in milliseconds for the last received ping and the average for all successful
    pings.
  </p>
  <h2 id="packetloss">Packet Loss</h2>
  <p>
    Packet loss is when a ping response is not received. It is graphed as a red square. The percent
    of all pings that were lost is also displayed. Packet loss is caused by many different factors
    and potentially indicates issues with your internet connection.
  </p>

  <h2 id="http">HTTP Test</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> is the foundational
    transportation technology used on the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    Makes a HTTP POST request with a random string body and verifies it is returned properly.
    Caching of the request is also explicitly disabled. This test is run every 30 seconds.
  </p>

  <h2 id="dns">DNS Test</h2>
  <p>
    The Domain Name System (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>) is
    the system that converts domain names (e.g. pinging.net) to an address that a computer
    understands (e.g. 192.168.100.100).
  </p>
  <p>
    Test DNS is working by making a HTTP GET request to a [random-number]dns-check.pinging.net.
    Caching is explicitly disabled and the random number part of the subdomain prevents common
    caching of the DNS lookup. This test is run every 30 seconds.
  </p>

  <h2 id="browser">Browser Check</h2>
  <p>
    Web browsers report if they believe you are offline. If this check is failing it means you are
    likely not connected to your WiFi, cellular connection or ethernet cord. This is a basic check
    and it will often pass even if you are not connected. This check is continuously monitored by
    your browser.
  </p>

  <h2 id="initial">Initial Load Check</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike most internet sites, caching is not allowed for this site. If this site loads, it is a
    strong indication your internet was working at the time it was loaded.
  </p>

  <h2>More Information</h2>
  <p>
    Speed is also an important attribute of your internet connection. It is not currently monitored
    by this site but can be measured on sites such as <a href="https://fast.com">fast.com</a> or
    <a href="https://www.speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have server locations around the world. Going to
    <a href="https://www.pinging.net">www.pinging.net</a>
    will route you to our nearest available server.
  </p>
  <p>You can also force using a server in a particular location. We currently have servers in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://iowa.pinging.net">Council Bluffs, Iowa, USA (Google Cloud)</a></li>
